<p>This is the home of my work and thoughts stemming from Free Code Camp's Data Visualization track.</p>

<h3>
<a id="why" class="anchor" href="#why" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why?</h3>

<p>Normally, I upload all my code to Github, but for the Free Code Camp Data Visualization Track, all projects had to be built on Codepen, which led to the code already being accessible, albeit with sub-optimal structure (because everything has to live in a single file, even for the big projects like my React Dungeon-Crawler game), and in a separate silo'ed space. As well, when I started to learn D3, and realized that much of the available tutorial material is sadly out of date, I wanted a place to share useful resources and found, and post updated versions of out-of-date tutorials.</p>

<a id="on-learning-d3" class="anchor" href="#on-learning-d3" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>On Learning D3</h3>

<p>I'm very new to D3, but so far, it's not really easy going. I'm not shocked--I'm not very visual, and I've never really mastered SVG or Canvas, or drawing (actually drawing or drawing with code) at all. But D3 has presented even more challenges than I'd have thought, because there's no guidance in place yet on the Free Code Camp site (well, there's <a href="https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/wiki/D3-Bar-Chart">this</a>, on github), and although there are tons of tutorials linked from the D3 site, by and large, they are written for version 3 of the library, which has been replaced by v4. There are some major, breaking changes that mean trying to use old code as your example while using the latest version will result in nothing working.</p>

<p>For some reason, the v4 tutorial content available to date (~4-5 months after the release), focuses on writing plugins, which is quite a distance from my current, basic goals for learning D3. So as I go along, I'm going to post useful resources here, as well as updated versions of tutorial code that works with v4, because in theory, v4 sounds great and I'd rather learn the latest than start off learning something that has already been replaced.</p>

<a id="changes-from-v3-to-v4" class="anchor" href="#changes-from-v3-to-v4" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Changes from v3 to v4</h4>

<p><a href="https://iros.github.io/d3-v4-whats-new">This slideshow</a> has been hugely helpful when it comes to understanding the differences between v3 and v4.</p>

<p>One key change: In v3, modules were namespaced like 'd3.scale.linear', whereas the introduction of ES6 modules in v4 led to the flattening of this hierarchy. Everything still uses the global 'd3.*', but *all your v3 code will break if you try to run it alongside the v4 library', until you flatten modules from 'd3.scale.linear' to 'ds.scaleLinear', or 'd3.time.year' to 'd3.timeYear'. This one change alone took me a good chunk of time to figure out/caused a fair bit of frustration. </p>

<a id="updated-tutorials" class="anchor" href="#updated-tutorials" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Updated Tutorials</h4>

<ul>
<li>I updated the code for <a href="https://bost.ocks.org/mike/bar/2/">Mike Bostock's Bar Chart tutorial (part II)</a>, one of the first, most basic examples, by changing one line. See <a href="https://gist.github.com/ubershibs/78cff6050a7afd3e746cdc90bd29b3d6">this gist</a>. (It's worth noting that part III is written using v4, but makes no mention of the version change between the steps).</li>
